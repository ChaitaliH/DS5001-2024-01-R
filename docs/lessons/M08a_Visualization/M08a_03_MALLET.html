<h1>Mallet</h1>
<p>Website: https://mimno.github.io/Mallet/</p>
<p>MALLET is a Java-based package for statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling, information extraction, and other machine learning applications to text.</p>
<p>MALLET includes sophisticated tools for document classification: efficient routines for converting text to “features”, a wide variety of algorithms (including Naïve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Decision Trees), and code for evaluating classifier performance using several commonly used metrics.</p>
<p>In addition to classification, MALLET includes tools for sequence tagging for applications such as named-entity extraction from text. Algorithms include Hidden Markov Models, Maximum Entropy Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields. These methods are implemented in an extensible system for finite state transducers.</p>
<p>Topic models are useful for analyzing large collections of unlabeled text. The MALLET topic modeling toolkit contains efficient, sampling-based implementations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Pachinko Allocation, and Hierarchical LDA.</p>
<p>Many of the algorithms in MALLET depend on numerical optimization. MALLET includes an efficient implementation of Limited Memory BFGS, among many other optimization methods.</p>
<p>In addition to sophisticated Machine Learning applications, MALLET includes routines for transforming text documents into numerical representations that can then be processed efficiently. This process is implemented through a flexible system of “pipes”, which handle distinct tasks such as tokenizing strings, removing stopwords, and converting sequences into count vectors.</p>
<p>An add-on package to MALLET, called GRMM, contains support for inference in general graphical models, and training of CRFs with arbitrary graphical structure.</p>
<section id="installation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To build a Mallet 2.0 development release, you must have the Apache ant build tool installed. From the command prompt, first change to the mallet directory, and then type <code>ant</code></p>
<p>If <code>ant</code> finishes with <code>"BUILD SUCCESSFUL"</code>, Mallet is now ready to use.</p>
<p>If you would like to deploy Mallet as part of a larger application, it is helpful to create a single “.jar” file that contains all of the compiled code. Once you have compiled the individual Mallet class files, use the command: <code>ant jar</code></p>
<p>This process will create a file “mallet.jar” in the “dist” directory within Mallet.</p>
</section>
<section id="usage" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Once you have installed Mallet you can use it using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>bin/mallet [command] --option value --option value ...</code></pre>
<p>Type <code>bin/mallet</code> to get a list of commands, and use the option <code>--help</code> with any command to get a description of valid options.</p>
<p>For details about the commands please visit the API documentation and website at: https://mimno.github.io/Mallet/</p>
